❓ PROMPT
You are designing an iPhone carousel widget that displays a list of apps in a vertical scrolling carousel. The apps array contains the names of the apps in the carousel from bottom to the top (index 0 for the bottom). 
The commands array contains the list of commands to navigate the vertical carousel, in all lowercase: "scroll up", "scroll down", and "tap".

The carousel works as follows:
* Initially, the first app in the apps array is selected.
* If the user taps on an app, it opens the app.
* If the user scrolls up, the carousel moves one app up. If the user scrolls down, the carousel moves one app down.
* If the user scrolls past the top of the carousel, the carousel wraps around to the bottom, and vice versa.
* Your task is to simulate the behavior of the carousel and return an array of strings representing the names of the opened apps.

Assume with every subsequent command, the user is already back on the home page, scrolling through the carousel again.

Example(s)
let apps = ["Maps", "Music", "Photos", "Messages", "Settings"]
let commands = ["tap", "scroll down", "scroll up", "scroll up", "scroll down", "scroll down", "tap"]

In this example, we first tap on "Maps" in the carousel (Index 0)
Scrolling down takes you to "Settings" (Index 4)
Scrolling up takes you back to "Maps" (Index 0)
Scrolling up takes you to "Music" (Index 1)
Scrolling down takes you to "Maps" (index 0)
Scrolling down again takes you to "Settings" (index 4)
Tap to open "Settings" (index 4)

Output: ["Maps", "Settings"]

function simulateCarousel(apps, commands){} // returns list of str
def simulate_carousel(apps: list[str], commands: list[str]) -> list[str]:
 

🧪 VERIFY
Run tests. Methodically debug & analyze issues.

scroll up => (current_index + 1)   {if current_index==max_index  current_index = max_index , current_index = 0}
scroll down => (current_index - 1) { if current_index==0 go to index[-1] }

carousel.tap() => (append value to array)

for command in commands:
    if command == 'scroll up':
        
        
Example(s)
let apps = ["Maps", "Music", "Photos", "Messages", "Settings"]
let commands = ["tap", "scroll down", "scroll up", "scroll up", "scroll down", "scroll down", "tap"]

Return ["Maps", "Settings"]
