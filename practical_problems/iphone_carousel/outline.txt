Approach:

Create var:
     current_index to keep track of current_index

Create arr :
    opened_apps to store apps opened     

Iterate through commands:
    If command is out of bounds in apps:
        reset the current_index

    If command == scroll up:
        current_index +1 

    Else-If command == scroll down:
        current_index - 1


    Return opened_apps
